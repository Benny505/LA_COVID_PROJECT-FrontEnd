Throughout you will find all important/interesting aspects of my family's last couple months in quarantine. You may be wondering why it was mentioned that others can share their experiences. If you look to the left of this paragraph you will see a text box that allows you to submit a name (optional) and some text. This particular one is just an example but there are others around the website (these boxes are toatally optional to write in. I made them mostly because I have too much time on my hands). PLEASE NOTE: this website was designed to be viewed on a laptop/computer (not a phone) and in chrome. If things aren't working as intended this is likely the issue.</p>
