            <p class="dark-green f4">Even though quarantine has brought about a lot of enjoyable new habits and opurtunities, I hope something like this doesn't happen again. Being couped up in the house with nothing to do can become maddening and even though I don't talk much, it is getting old talking to the same three people (and only them) every day. That and the fact that a lot of disc golf events are cancelled makes me say that even though I did enjoy it (and still kind of am), I will feel refreshed the day that it ends.</p>
