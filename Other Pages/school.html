            <hr style="margin: 0px; border-color: #137752;">
            <p class="dark-green f4">Taking class online is pretty different than what I'm used to. I find it fantastic that I only have to get out of bed, get ready for the day and go to my laptop to make it to school on time. It allows me to sleep for an extra hour. As far as absorbing information goes, its pretty much the same as in person. LA and social studies are a little more difficult becuase the way they are taught makes it much easier if one is in class. Aside from that and the fact that sometimes it can be hard to do a lot of work at one time when I'm at home, it's great!</p>

            <hr style="margin: 0px; border-color: #137752;">
            <p class="dark-green f4">There is obviously much less of this. I'm not a very social person in general though so I actually find it nice not having to comunicate (most of the time). When it comes to getting questions answered, I find that I like email more. Aside from the occasional long response time email is perfect because it makes sure that both parties understand what the question is before one of them starts explaining it in detail, it makes everything documented and organized and email tends to be more clean and concise.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 0px; border-color: #137752;">
            <p class="dark-green f4">This is amazing. Finals are all but called off, nothing is completely for marks and life is just generally less stressful. When it comes to online quizes, I do them all trying not to look into my notes while doing them. Its great not being worried about marks all the time but still being able to show what you know. This system, in many ways seems superior to the normal version.</p>
