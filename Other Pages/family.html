            <hr style="margin: 0px; border-color: #137752;">
            <p class="dark-green f4">Needless to say, Covid has made family events difficult. Get togethers? More like stay aparts! Birthdays can be disapointing in these times as well. Believe it or not, all of my family member's birthdays (aside from my own) are all over quarentine. Luckily, other than my sister no one in my family likes big birthdays. The only other thing that was over quarentine so far was Easter and we don't really go out for that either.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 0px; border-color: #137752;">
            <p class="dark-green f4">When it comes to job status, my family is very fortunate. One of my parents had to start working from home and the other (who is a healthcare worker) has been under more stress. Other than that no changes have befallen us. My sister got laid off from her library job, though she has never been any more busy as a babysitter.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 0px; border-color: #137752;">
            <p class="dark-green f4">As a family, we have always spent plenty of time together. Of course, not as much as we do now. With all of this spare time we play plenty of board games, my sister and mother have gotten really into gardening and my father and I play more disc golf than ever before. Thus, even though Covid19 can be a terror, it has been nice to spend more time with family.</p>

            <p class="dark-green f4">Though there aren't many things inconveniencing us in these times; we have had some dissapointments. The trip to Italy we had planned for quite a while was cancelled last minute because of the sudden outbreak in Italy. Other than that my father and sister had to cancel their trip to Ontario to see family.</p>
